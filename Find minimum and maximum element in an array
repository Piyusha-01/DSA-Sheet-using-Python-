Find minimum and maximum element in an array
Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
Note: Return an array that contains 2 elements the first one will be a minimum element and the second will be a maximum of an array.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 6
A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
Output: 1 10000
Explanation: minimum and maximum elements of array are 1 and 10000.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
Output: 1 56789
Explanation: minimum and maximum element of array are 1 and 56789.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <=1012


solution:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def getMinMax( a, n):
    max=a[0]
    min=a[0]
    for i in range(1,n):
        if (a[i] >= max):
            max=a[i]
        if (a[i] <= min):
            min=a[i]
    return min,max
